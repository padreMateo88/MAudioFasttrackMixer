# MAudioFastTrackMixer
Application for controlling built in DSP mixer of M-Audio Fasttrack Ultra 8R USB audio interface with an Android device

FasttrackUltraDigitalMixer is a tool designed to control the digital audio mixer built into the MAudio  Fasttrack Ultra 8R USB audio interface with an Android device. You can connect the audio interface to your phone via USB OTG connection.  The app is designed to make live mixing more convinient than the stock desktop app supplied with the interface. The youser can controll the sliders with a touchscreen. Save snapshot of created mixes and easily recall them with a panel situated on the main screen. The UI is designed so that the most  vital functions of the mixer are controlled from one sceen, which lets the user access quickly. This is espetially important for artists, who handle sound engineering themselves during small gigs. The app is also fitted with a MUTE FX button, which is espetially usefull for turning off the reverb or delay between songs, while the artist talks to the audience. 

My thanks to Katarzyna Szymanek for help with the reverse engineering of the USB connection protocol and Wacław Szabłowski for his work on the UI on the early stage of the project.
